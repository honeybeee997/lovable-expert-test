## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Lead not being saved in supabase

**File**: `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

There were multiple issues in the file.

- Lead not being saved in the database.
- Lead getting the confirmation email twice.

#### Root Cause

The `send-confirmation` edge function was being called twice. Whereas There should have been 2 things happening, first to save the lead, second to send the confirmation email upon successful save.

#### Fix

Removed the duplicate `send-confirmation` call and replaced it with the actual lead saving code.

```ts
const {error: insertError} = await supabase.from('leads').insert([
  {
    name: formData.name,
    email: formData.email,
    industry: formData.industry,
  },
]);
```

#### Impact

- ✅ Lead being saved in the DB
- ✅ Not sending duplicate false confirmation emails

### 2. Fixed the personalized content generation fuction

**File**: `supabase/functions/send-confirmation.ts`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem

The `generatePersonalizedContent` function was returning `undefined` which was breaking the app while sending the lead confirmation emails.

#### Root Cause

```ts
return data?.choices[1]?.message?.content;
```

The `data.choices` is an array having only 1 item. `data.choices[1]` is undefined.

#### Fix

Just moved the index from `data.choices[1]` to `data.choices[0]` and it fixed the content generation function. It now returns the actual data it receives from the OpenAI.

### 3. Frontend was not handling errors gracefully

**File**: `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem

Even when the lead was not being saved and the confirmation email was not being sent, the frontend was not showing any error. It was showing a success screen.

#### Root Cause

There is this state in the `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`

```ts
const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);
```

It decides wheter the data was successfully submitted or not. The issue was that even if there was some error the state was being set to true at the end of the submit function, which was eventually showing the wrong success UI.

#### Fix

We only set the `setSubmitted(true)` if the data was saved and the confirmation email was sent successfully.

#### Impact

- ✅ No false truth screen
- ✅ User can know that there was some issue while submission
- ✅ Enhanced user experience

## Improved user experience

**File**: `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`

Previously, when the data was being submitted, the user had no clue because there was no loading state in the form. User was kinda stuck pressing the submit button multiple times.

I've now added a loader in the submit button which will appear while the data is being submitted to the backend. This gives user a feedback that something is happening in the background.

Additionally, I've also used the toast from `sonner`to show if there are any errors while subimtting the data so that the user can know that the data was not submitted and he might try again.
